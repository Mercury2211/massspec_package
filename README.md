# MassSpec Package

## Overview
The **MassSpec Package** is designed for analyzing recordings from an **Acqiris ADC card** for **Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (TOF-MS)**.  
It provides a GUI-based interface to process and visualize data.

---

## **Installation**
To install the package, use:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/Mercury2211/massspec_package.git
```
Ensure you have `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `tkinter` installed.

---

## **Launching the GUI**
The package provides three different GUI applications for mass spectrometry analysis.
Each GUI can be launched with a single line of code. Every GUI also offers the option to save the data
used for plotting‚Äîeither as a .txt or .csv file‚Äîfor further analysis.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Difference Plotter GUI**
Used for **Subtracting a Background Measurement from a Measurement**. Therefore, select two folders
(one for the measurement and one for the background).
```python
import massspec_package
massspec_package.launch_difference_plotter()
```
‚úÖ **Title:** "Background Subtraction"

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Intensity Over Time GUI**
Used for visualizing signal intensity over time. First, select a measurement folder. The program automatically plots the 
first measurement from the folder, which helps you choose an x-range in which the program will find the maximum value. 
These maximum values are then plotted over ‚Äútime.‚Äù (Tip: Select an x-range that encloses the desired mass peak. This ensures 
the final plot shows the intensity of that specific peak over time.)
```python
import massspec_package
massspec_package.launch_intensity_gui()
```
‚úÖ **Title:** "Intensity Over Time Analysis"

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Single Waveform Analysis GUI**
Used for **plotting selected waveform files**. First, select a measurement folder. You can then pick the 
specific waveforms of interest.
```python
import massspec_package
massspec_package.launch_single_waveform_gui()
```
‚úÖ **Title:** "Single Waveform Analysis"

---

## **Manual Usage**
For advanced users, you can manually interact with the classes:

```python
from massspec_package.data_processor import DataProcessor
processor = DataProcessor("C:/path/to/data")
voltages = processor.calculate_summed_voltages()
print(voltages)
```

```python
from massspec_package.voltage_plotter import VoltagePlotter
plotter = VoltagePlotter(measurement_processor, background_processor)
plotter.plot_difference()
```
